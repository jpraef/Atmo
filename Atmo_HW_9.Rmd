Homework #9: 13.1, 13.4, 13.5

13.1  
Using the diameter information from Table 13.1, calculate how many (a) gas molecules, (b) medium aerosol particles, and (c) fog drops make up the vol- ume of a single medium raindrop. Use average diameters where applicable.

13.4  
Calculate the number concentration of raindrops from the Marshall–Palmer distribution in the diameter ranges (a) 200–300 μm and (b) 800–900 μm, when R = 25 mm h−1. Why are the number concentrations different in the two size ranges?

13.5  
Compare the number concentrations of drops between 18 and 22 μm in diameter at the base and at the top of a nimbostratus cloud using a modified gamma distribution. Why do you think the concentrations differ in the two cases?
